# Network-Attached Storage: Data Storage Applications

### What is the primary problem that the author hopes to address?

The author hopes to address the problems of multi-to-one and one-to-multi configurations, the slow speed of current file servers, simplify the management and distribution of the file server, centralize storage of data, and make the data easily available.

### What are the authors' main contribution to the solution of this problem?

The author contributed the NAS system which is a file-level storage server connected to a network. Hence Network Attached Storage.

### What is the most important limitation of their solution?

Network stability is a limitation of NAS

### According to the authors, the previous work most closely related to theirs is? but that work didn't solve the problem entirely because?

3Com and Auspex Systems developed MAS and NFS servers, but they did not important the contributions listed above

### This system was evaluated by?

There was no evaluation.

### One other possible way to evaluate the work would be?

A study of several NAS users where the users used a NAS for several weeks, periodically filling out System Usability Score(SUS) survey could have provided valuable feedback.
